                This interactive hunt invites you to explore seven mysteries inspired by the works of artist Toru Kuranuki.
                Hidden across this digital landscape are seven <strong>Echo Stations</strong>, each presenting a riddle based on
                legendary stones. Solve the riddle to collect a digital <strong>Echo Token</strong>. Once you collect all seven,
                the secrets of the <em>Symphony of Stones</em> will be revealed.
